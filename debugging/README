   Debugging ::
   =========

   Anusaaraka provides a debugging tool to find and reduce the bugs in the translation.

   For debugging:
   $ cd $HOME_anu_test/debugging/sentence_debug
   $ sentence_debug.sh <file_name> <sentence_number>   Ex:$ sentence_debug.sh  mytest  2.1
                                                         (Ex: for 1st sentence of 2nd paragraph of the input file "mytest")

  (NOTE : For debugging, basic knowledge of CLIPS is required.)
  

  NOTE: If you think that it is necessary to make changes/add something in the data files, then follow the following steps.
        step 1 : Go to the respective data file 
                 $HOME_anu_test/debugging/provisional_Anu_databases/<file_name>
        step 2 : Make changes/add  according to the pattern in the file.
        step 3 : compile the file using the following command:
                 sh $HOME_anu_test/debugging/provisional_Anu_databases/compile.sh 
        step 4 : Run the sentence after compiling. And, if the changes made are effective then mail the changes
                 to anusaaraka team.
        step 5 : Reset (ITS IMPORTANT TO RESET)
                 $sh $HOME_anu_test/debugging/provisional_Anu_databases/reset.sh
