  Writing regular Expressions:
  Example::
  Sen            ::   I gave a book to Dashrath, the king of Ayodhya.
  default_parse  ::   splits "Dashrath" and "the king of Ayodhya" as different phrases (NP && NP)

  needed_parse   ::   "Dashrath the king of Ayodhya" should be within one phrase (NP)          
 		 -->   Regular expression for this parse is 
		       S < ( VP < ( PP [< NP [<< Ayodhya & << Dashrath]  & < TO]))

  NOTE:-
 1) By default it generates 25 parses for a sentence, if one want to see more parsers change the "-printPCFGkBest 25" option     to desired number in "$HOME_anu_test/Parsers/stanford-parser/stanford-parser-2010-11-30/run_multiple_parse_penn.sh" file.
