Similarly, static friction is important in daily life.
Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other.
Consider two cases of motion.
In the second case, the car moves from O to P and then moves back from P to Q.
The magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding path length is not zero.
The symbol âˆ‘ (the Greek letter sigma) denotes summation, in this case over n particles.
We shall, in the present chapter, consider rotational motion about a fixed axis only.
The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year.
In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error.
We now know that color is associated with wavelength of light.
Where P is the net power of the lens combination.
In silica glass fibers, it is possible to transmit more than 95 % of the light over a fiber length of 1 km.
A standard 100 watt incadescent light bulb emits approximately 1700 lumens.
There are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from common experience.
Only the component perpendicular to the surface, i.e., the normal component of the momentum, gets reversed in reflection.
