Similarly, static friction is important in daily life.
Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other.
Consider two cases of motion.
In the second case, the car moves from O to P and then moves back from P to Q.
The magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding path length is not zero.
