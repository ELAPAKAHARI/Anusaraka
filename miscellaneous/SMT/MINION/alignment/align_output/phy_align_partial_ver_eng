Similarly, static friction is important in daily life.
Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other.
Consider two cases of motion.
In the second case, the car moves from O to P and then moves back from P to Q.
The magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding path length is not zero.
The symbol âˆ‘ (the Greek letter sigma) denotes summation, in this case over n particles.
We shall, in the present chapter, consider rotational motion about a fixed axis only.
The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year.
In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error.
