Similarly, static friction is important in daily life.
Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other.
Consider two cases of motion.
In the second case, the car moves from O to P and then moves back from P to Q.
The magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding path length is not zero.
The symbol âˆ‘ (the Greek letter sigma) denotes summation, in this case over n particles.
We shall, in the present chapter, consider rotational motion about a fixed axis only.
The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year.
In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error.
We now know that color is associated with wavelength of light.
Where P is the net power of the lens combination.
In silica glass fibers, it is possible to transmit more than 95 % of the light over a fiber length of 1 km.
A standard 100 watt incadescent light bulb emits approximately 1700 lumens.
There are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from common experience.
Only the component perpendicular to the surface, i.e., the normal component of the momentum, gets reversed in reflection.
In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion.
Motion of an object can be represented by a position-time graph as you have already learned about it.
To describe this, we define the quantity average velocity.
We have seen earlier that the magnitude of displacement may be different from the actual path length.
Thus, in this case the average speed is equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.
Thus, in this case the average speed is not equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.
For this, we define instantaneous velocity or simply velocity v at an instant t.
Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the magnitude of velocity.
How to describe this change?
Like velocity, acceleration can also be positive, negative or zero.
Equation (3.7) can also be written as.
In this case, the magnitude of displacement (360 m) is equal to the path length (360 m).
Thus, the stopping distance is proportional to the square of the initial velocity.
It is a common observation that a ball bouncing from a smooth plane surface obeys the laws of reflection.
In this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be considered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining them.
First, that it travels with enormous speed and second, that it travels in a straight line.
An incoming wave can be divided into two weaker waves at the boundary between air and water.
The early civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia and many others made vital contributions to its progress.
From the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made in science in Europe.
This approach is called reductionism and is at the heart of physics.
