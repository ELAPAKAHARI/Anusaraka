It is impossible for a car to move on a very slippery road.
In many practical situations, however, friction is critically needed.
Displacement has both magnitude and direction. 
How does the position change with time? 
In this chapter, we shall learn how to describe motion.
For this, we develop the concepts of velocity and acceleration.
Finally, to understand the relative nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.
The speed of light in vacuum is the highest speed attainable in nature.
He made pioneering contributions in the field of optics.
In these examples, the external agency of force (hands, wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object.
You should now be able to handle a large variety of problems in mechanics.
This is the energy which is released in a nuclear power generation and nuclear explosions.
Energy is a scalar quantity.
These laws can be derived from Newton's laws of motion in mechanics.
The reflected ray follows laws of reflection.
We now apply the sign convention.
Hence, all the three will have negative signs.
