Good Princess, I cannot sell my donkey.
He's my friend.
I can't do without him.
I want to buy this donkey.
The Princess was very surprised to hear this.
And, turning to her guards, she ordered them to seize Dipu.
In spite of the threat, Dipu remained silent.
Guard, stop this donkey and let me get off his back!
I'll go for a walk in the forest.
What are you doing here?
I'm going for a walk, said the Princess.
That's very kind of you, said the Princess gratefully.
My name is Kular.
The Princess began to weep.
You are known to be sly and cunning.
If we help the Princess perhaps she'll change.
She'll become a better person.
Hungry and thirsty! said Dipu sympathetically.
Just a moment, we'll solve your problem.
Thank you, she said.
I am the landlord's daughter.
Your father dug this pit to trap elephants like me.
I want to introduce you to my father.
He'll be so pleased to meet you.
Dipu introduced his Sonar Bagan friends to the two.
Papri asked.
He could tell that they would be sad to lose him.
He said to his friends, I wish to stay with Mangal and Sukhi for a while.
Awake so early?
Dipu remarked.
What's that?
Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth, Sukhi explained.
We are as poor as ever.
I hope I can remember the words.
Sleepy-head that he was, he was snoozing on his pink lily bed in the pond.
Sukhi would be upset, since it was the day of Lakshmi Puja.
I'll show you a secret.
In fact, all Dipu's friends are here to help him.
He must be very worried about me.
He returned shortly, shaking his head.
