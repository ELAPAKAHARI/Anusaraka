Similarly, static friction is important in daily life.
Automobiles and planes carry people from one place to the other.
Consider two cases of motion.
The magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding path length is not zero.
The symbol âˆ‘ (the Greek letter sigma) denotes summation, in this case over n particles.
We shall, in the present chapter, consider rotational motion about a fixed axis only.
The earth rotates once every twenty-four hours and revolves round the sun once in a year.
In a good number of situations in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can be considered as point-like objects without much error.
We now know that color is associated with wavelength of light.
Where P is the net power of the lens combination.
Through another experiment, Faraday showed that this relative motion is not an absolute requirement.
A standard 100 watt incadescent light bulb emits approximately 1700 lumens.
There are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from common experience.
Only the component perpendicular to the surface, i.e., the normal component of the momentum, gets reversed in reflection.
In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without going into the causes of motion.
Motion of an object can be represented by a position-time graph as you have already learned about it.
To describe this, we define the quantity average velocity.
We have seen earlier that the magnitude of displacement may be different from the actual path length.
Thus, in this case the average speed is equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.
Thus, in this case the average speed is not equal to the magnitude of the average velocity.
For this, we define instantaneous velocity or simply velocity v at an instant t.
Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the magnitude of velocity.
How to describe this change?
Equation (3.7) can also be written as.
In this case, the magnitude of displacement (360 m) is equal to the path length (360 m).
Thus, the stopping distance is proportional to the square of the initial velocity.
It is a common observation that a ball bouncing from a smooth plane surface obeys the laws of reflection.
In this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be considered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining them.
First, that it travels with enormous speed and second, that it travels in a straight line.
An incoming wave can be divided into two weaker waves at the boundary between air and water.
The early civilisations of Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia and many others made vital contributions to its progress.
From the sixteenth century onwards, great strides were made in science in Europe.
This approach is called reductionism and is at the heart of physics.
In our experience, force is needed to push, carry or throw objects, deform or break them.
Early thinkers like Aristotle had wrong ideas about it.
It is enormously strong compared to gravity.
This is almost inevitable with ladies garments like a polyester saree.
You can perform the following activity at home to experience such an effect.
A dramatic observation is that a pith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with plastic rod (Fig. 1.1 (f)).
This might have been the philosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative.
Ampere and Faraday supported this observation by saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets generate electricity.
We know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of the same magnitude, the sum is zero.
This forms the leaves of your electroscope.
The separation is a rough measure of the amount of charge on the electroscope.
Fold the strips into half so that you make a mark of fold.
The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope.
The scientific method involves several interconnected steps: Systematic observations, controlled experiments, qualitative and quantitative reasoning, mathematical modelling, prediction and verification or falsification of theories.
The interplay of theory and observation (or experiment) is basic to the progress of science.
The effort is to see the physical world as manifestation of some universal laws in different domains and conditions.
A related effort is to derive the properties of a bigger, more complex, system from the properties and interactions of its constituent simpler parts.
Basically, there are two domains of interest: macroscopic and microscopic.
The microscopic domain includes atomic, molecular and nuclear phenomena.
Classical Physics deals mainly with macroscopic phenomena and includes subjects like Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Optics and Thermodynamics.
A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.
However, at the end of the time interval, observations show that each body acquires the same momentum.
Let us note at this stage some important points about the second law.
The actual resistive force, and therefore, retardation of the bullet may not be uniform.
What is the origin of the external force on the body?
The compressed spring in turn exerts a force on your hand and you can feel it.
To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction.
Let us note some important points about the third law, particularly in regard to the usage of the terms: action and reaction.
They add up to give a null force.
How to find the force on the wall?
The direction of impulse (and force) is the same as in (a) and is normal to the wall along the negative x direction.
As before, using Newton's third law, the force on the wall due to the ball is normal to the wall along the positive x direction.
Since initially, both are at rest, the change in momentum equals the final momentum for each.
This fact is known as the law of conservation of momentum.
The total momentum of an isolated system of interacting particles is conserved.
Equilibrium of a particle in mechanics refers to the situation when the net external force on the particle is zero.
The horizontal and vertical components of the resultant force must vanish separately.
Every object on the earth experiences the force of gravity due to the earth.
Gravity also governs the motion of celestial bodies.
All the other forces common in mechanics are contact forces.
When bodies are in contact (e.g. a book resting on a table, a system of rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and other types of supports), there are mutual contact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying the third law.
In Chapter 1, we learned that there are four fundamental forces in nature.
The different contact forces of mechanics mentioned above fundamentally arise from electrical forces.
Yet they are very useful in practical calculations in mechanics.
In many situations, like in a machine with different moving parts, friction does have a negative role.
Besides, each body in the assembly experiences the force of gravity.
Include also the forces on the system by other agencies.
(ii) the force on the floor by the system (action); the force on the system by the floor (reaction).
