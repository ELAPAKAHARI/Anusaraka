#This document enable you to train the parallel corpus using Stanford Phrasal & deployment of it for transliteration purpose.

1. PRE-REQUISITE
	-Stanford Phrasal
	-CoreNLP
	-SRILM 

2. DOWNLOAD & INSTALLATION

     i)SRILM : it is used to build language model.You can install it from Synaptic Package Manager. 
	i) Install srilm & srilm-doc. or
	ii) Download from the site :
	 http://www-speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html

    ii)Stanford Phrasal :You can install the package using following step :-
	Step 1 : click on http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/software/phrasal/.
	Step 2:  export PHRASAL=$PWD/phrasal.Beta2
	Step 3:  tar -xzvf phrasal.Beta2.tar.gz 

   iii)CoreNLP : You can install the package using following step :-
	Step 1: click on http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml
	Step 2: export CORENLP=$PWD/stanford-corenlp-2011-06-08
	Step 3: tar -xzvf stanford-corenlp-v1.0.4.tgz

NOTE: This training should be done once in the system & after that only work directory can be deployed for transliteration.

3. TRAINING OF PARALLEL DATA USING STANFORD PHRASAL
       
	i)mkdir work
       ii)copy aligner.conf & phrasal.conf in work directory  from the following link -
	 http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/wiki/Software/Phrasal
	-edit aligner.conf file : remove “lowercase” from file content
	 (condition: only  if hindi file is in wx-notation)

NOTE : Depend upon your parallel corpus change foreignSuffix & englishSuffix in aligner.conf file ( eg: en & hi for english & hindi)

     iii)For automatic training of parallel corpus execute training-script.sh present in  work directory
		sh training-script.sh

NOTE: Once training is done, you just need to copy the work directory in target system with required software.

4. To deploy the transliteration system to another machine :
	Step 1: Install  Stanford Phrasal, CoreNLP in target system.
	Step 2: Send work directory of training to the target system.
        	    Edit file 
	            work/phrasal-mert/phrasal.final.ini ,
		    in it set the path of the directory to the current directory where 'work' is placed. 
	Step 3: Change the permissions of the files
        		chmod +x phrasal.Beta2/scripts/decode
		        chmod +x phrasal.Beta2/scripts/split-table 
	Step 4: Removed JAVA_OPTS '-XX:+UseCompressedOops' from 
        	phrasal.Beta2/scripts/decode
	        phrasal.Beta2/scripts/extract-phrases

NOTE: the work directory consist of:
		-training-script.sh
		-transliteration-script.sh
		-parallel corpus
		-trained intermediate files( models, phrasal-mert,
		 language model,aligner.conf, phrasal.conf)
